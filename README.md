-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Engage users through interviews, surveys, and testing to understand needs, then implement them iteratively with stakeholder feedback. User stories clarify requirements, prioritize features, and guide development to meet user expectations.

-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Develop programs iteratively with clear goals, stakeholder collaboration, and tools like JIRA for transparency. Incorporate Daily Scrums, Sprint Planning, Backlog Refinement, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives to ensure adaptability and efficiency.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member actively participates in Agile processes, communicates clearly, collaborates to resolve issues, and adapts to changing requirements. They maintain accountability and contribute to a transparent, cohesive team environment.
